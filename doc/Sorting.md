 - Bucket https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucket_sort
   "Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the
    elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted
    individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively
    applying the bucket sorting algorithm."

 - Radix Sort https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort
   "In computer science, radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that
   sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share
   the same significant position and value."

## Classification

### Stable sorting.

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output
as they appear in the input unsorted array.
