To setup Fedora's root password, after initial installation,
use `passed` from under the regular login(that is a sudoer):

    $ sudo passwd root

Cuda seems to have the repositories for Fedora 29 latest.

Fedora has a few desktops by default.
Switching using Alt-F1, Alt-F2, ..., and Alt-Tab works.
