Kirchhoff's theorem (about the number of spanning trees of a graph)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_theorem

t(G) = 1/n * lambda1 * lambda2 * ... * lambda(n-1)
where lambda(i) is non-zero eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix.

Laplacian matrix
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix
L = D - A
D - degree matrix (on diagonal - the number of connections of a node)
A - adjacency matrix (0 - not connected, 1 - connected)

mod m:
n = q * m + R
R - remainder

Horner's rule - the rule to compute polinomials without having to get powers of x.
Sum(a[i]*x^i) for i from 0 to n:

    int Horner(int a[], unsigned int n, int x) {
        int result = a[n];
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; --i)
            result = result * n + a [i];
