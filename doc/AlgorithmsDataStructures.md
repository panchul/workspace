Horner's rule - the rule to compute polinomials without having to get powers of x.
Sum(a[i]*x^i) for i from 0 to n:

    int Horner(int a[], unsigned int n, int x) {
        int result = a[n];
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; --i)
            result = result * n + a [i];
    
        return result;
    }
