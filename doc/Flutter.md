## Installing

---

https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-ios

On MacOs:

Check `zsh` is the default:

```bash
$ dscl . -read ~/ UserShell
UserShell: /bin/zsh
```

You can change the shell if needed:

```bash
$ chsh -s `which zsh`
```

Some Flutter components require the Rosetta 2 translation process on Macs running Apple silicon. To run all Flutter components on Apple silicon, install Rosetta 2.

```bash
sudo softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license
```

See [Installing CocoaPods](CocoaPods.md#installing)

```bash
% sudo gem install cocoapods

Successfully installed cocoapods-1.16.2
Parsing documentation for cocoapods-1.16.2
Done installing documentation for cocoapods after 0 seconds
1 gem installed
```

[Ruby](Ruby.md#installing) might need upgrading, or you may downgrade drb, and a couple of other gems:

```bash
% sudo gem install drb
Password:
Fetching drb-2.2.1.gem
Successfully installed drb-2.2.1
Parsing documentation for drb-2.2.1
Installing ri documentation for drb-2.2.1
Done installing documentation for drb after 1 seconds
1 gem installed
```

Or a specific version:

```bash
sudo gem install drb -v 2.0.6
```

Easiest way to install Flutter SDK via Visual Studio Code:

- open command palette, `Comand+Shift+P`
- type `flutter`
- select `Flutter: New Project`
- click `Locate SDK` or `Download SDK`

You may need to add `flutter/bin` to your `PATH` in, for example, `.zshrc`

## fvm

Flutter Version Management: A cli to manage Flutter SDK versions.

https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation

How to setup `fvm`:

For example, building the version for android:

```bash
fvm flutter build apk
```

## Debugging

---

For debugging, you can pick the target device (using Shift-Option-P and 'flutter'),
and use `--debug` option:

```bash
$ flutter run --debug
