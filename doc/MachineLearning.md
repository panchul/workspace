Some data science fun

- Artificial Intelligence = linear regression & decision trees
- Smart Algorithms = random forest
- Next-Gen machine learning = boosted trees
- AutoML = import autosklearn
- Intelligent Automation = Windows scheduler, crontab
- MLOps = docker
- Analytics at scale = no more excel
- Customer-centric data lake = we have customer_id in our database tables
- Serverless Architecture = I have no idea what a server is
- Cloud APIs = my dev-ops guy made me click some link
- Advanced Analytics = SQL
- DataViz Guru = library(ggplot2)
- Data Consultant = often draws convenient conclusions from data
- Advanced ML/DL = Python
- High Performance Model Training = model.cuda()
- Image Recognition = MNIST
- NLP Experts = transfer learning on GTP-3/Bert
- Reproducible experiments = jupyter notebooks
- Maintain source code = git add . && git commit -m "yolo" && git push origin master
- Distributed Analytics = no more MySQL on a laptop
- Experimentation Framework = z-tests
- Advanced Statistics = random control groups
- Customer loyalty focus = we spam them with emails
- Centre of Excellence = fancy team name to justify payrises
- HR analytics = people leave, we didn't pay them enough
