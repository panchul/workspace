## Installing

---

from [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Read what it says, e.g. you will need to add brew to PATH:

```bash
    echo >> /Users/joebiden/.zprofile
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/joebiden/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```
