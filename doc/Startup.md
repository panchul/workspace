From Internet:

Everyone knows Steve Jobs.

But few know about the millionaire who mentored him...

In 1976, Steve Jobs was just a 21-year-old college dropout.

Working out of his garage, he had a dream of making computers accessible to everyone.

But he had no money or business experience to turn his vision into reality.

Until Mike Markkula saw something in him.

Markkula was a millionaire who'd made his fortune at Intel, and saw something special in Jobs.

He wrote a $250,000 check (about $1.2M today) to Apple for one-third of the company.

But money wasn't his biggest contribution.

Markkula became Apple's first chairman and Jobs' mentor.

He taught the young founder lessons that would shape Apple's destiny.

Without his guidance, Apple might have remained a small computer hobby shop.

Instead, it became the most valuable company in history.

Here are the 7 biggest lessons Jobs learned from him:

1. Marketing isn't about selling products

It's about selling dreams.

Markkula taught Jobs that people don't buy computers – they buy what computers enable them to do.

This shaped Apple's entire approach to marketing, focusing on empowering users rather than technical specs.

2. Quality must be embedded in company DNA

Markkula insisted that even internal memos be perfectly written.

Every detail mattered – from product packaging to store design.

This obsession with quality became Apple's hallmark, influencing everything they created.

3. Think in decades, not quarters

When Apple was struggling to sell the Apple I, Markkula pushed Jobs to think bigger.

He saw personal computers as a 30-year revolution that would change how people live and work.

This long-term vision gave Jobs confidence to make bold, unconventional decisions.

4. Build for the future customer

Markkula taught Jobs that great companies don't just serve existing needs.

They anticipate future ones.

This philosophy led Apple to create products people didn't know they wanted – like the iPhone and iPad.

5. Focus ruthlessly

When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he cut 70% of their products.

This wasn't his idea – it was Markkula's philosophy:

"Do a few things exceptionally well, rather than many things adequately."

6. Create an empowering culture

Markkula showed Jobs how to build a company culture that attracted top talent.

His approach? Give talented people impossible challenges, then get out of their way.

This became the foundation of Apple's innovation engine.

7. Never compromise on vision

When Apple was struggling in its early days, investors pushed to lower prices.

Markkula backed Jobs' refusal to compromise on quality.

He taught Jobs that short-term profits should never override long-term vision.
