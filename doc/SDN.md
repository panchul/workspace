Nice summary from here:
https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/software-defined-networking

Four main models:

- Open SDN: Network administrators use a protocol like OpenFlow to control
  the behavior of virtual and physical switches at the data plane level.
- SDN by APIs: Instead of using an open protocol, application programming
  interfaces control how data moves through the network on each device.
- SDN Overlay Model: Another type of software-defined networking runs a
  virtual network on top of an existing hardware infrastructure, creating
  dynamic tunnels to different on-premise and remote data centers. The virtual
  network allocates bandwidth over a variety of channels and assigns devices
  to each channel, leaving the physical network untouched.
- Hybrid SDN: This model combines software-defined networking with traditional
  networking protocols in one environment to support different functions on
  a network. Standard networking protocols continue to direct some traffic,
  while SDN takes on responsibility for other traffic, allowing network
  administrators to introduce SDN in stages to a legacy environment.
