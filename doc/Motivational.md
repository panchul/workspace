"10 Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives" by Dr. Laura Schlessinger

- Stupid Attachment – Looking to the context of a man to find and define yourself
- Stupid Courtship – Becoming a beggar, not a chooser, in the dating ritual because you are desperate.
- Stupid Devotion – Finding yourself driven to love, and suffer, and succor (or is that “sucker”?) in vain.
- Stupid Passion – Having sex too soon and setting yourself up to be burned
- Stupid Cohabitation – Lying to yourself and living with him because you hope he’ll want you
- Stupid Expectations – Using marriage as a quick fix for low or no self-esteem
- Stupid Conception – Using biology misguidedly as a jump-start for love, personal growth, and commitment
- Stupid Subjugation – Allowing you and your children to be held hostage by your own obsessive need for security and attachment
- Stupid Helplessness – Being too scared and insecure to deal with your rage and turning it into wimpyness instead.
- Stupid Forgiving – Not knowing when to break off a no-win relationship or how to not get involved in the first place.

Neat thoughts about rejection, from
https://www.elephantjournal.com/2017/06/what-it-really-means-if-youve-been-ghosted-dumped-unfriended-or-blocked/

A quote from there:
"There is nothing wrong with you. We are all guilty of taking rejection
 personally, especially when we rely on the outside validation of other
 people’s opinions. Someone else’s actions have nothing to do with us.
 What someone else thinks or does, or how they choose to treat us, is
 separate from us, and should not be used as confirmation for the way
 we feel about ourselves—good or bad. So rest assured, you’re still
 wonderful, worthy, real, good, and important…no matter what."

"Before success comes in any man's life, he's sure to meet with
 much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat
 overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do
 is to quit. That's exactly what the majority of men do."
  ―Napoleon Hill
