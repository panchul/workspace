This Wiki was created to describe the intended usage of the ```workspace```
repository, and of those sandboxes that are mature enough to be useful for
the ousiders.

You can also look at it as a collection of useful hint and tricks.
Currently I am migrating all sorts of random files I accumulated over
years, organizing them by topic, making cross-references and revising
the content.
