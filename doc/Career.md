51 Essential Machine Learning Interview Questions and Answers
https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-interview-questions/

---

When acquaintances ask for my mentoring advice on their career path, the very first thing
I always do is discourage them from individual-contributor contracts. 

I tried it in the past, and I was actually lucky to have met good teams and stay in touch with
colleagues I met through consulting, but, on average, it is a commodity-labor sweat-shop environment,
you might end up doing the bulk of the work, underpaid, underappreciated, and discarded
the moment your client's short-sighted roadmap hits the last page of the PowerPoint presentation.

I always emphasize contracting is not Computer Science. It is a mundane dead-end blue-collar transaction.
Nobody bothers discussing supersonic hydrodynamics with a plumber who fixes a broken toilet, right?
You will not be invited to co-author journal papers and patents - sharing intellectual
property with vendors is a legal headache.

Because you are not a professional salary negotiator, your staffing company can easily be
taking 1/3 of what client pays and do nothing in return except for the initial presenting of your profile.
You will have very limited control over what you do and how you do it. It is not uncommon to have to
shadow write for your bosses and then see them taking all the credit without mentioning you exist.

It is ok to explore and make the best of it, but what will be in YOUR best interests is to
find a direc-hire FTE job somewhere else and leave faster than your middleman could spell 'counteroffer'.

One more thing, once you are the boss, try being honest and compassionate to the contractors if
you do need to hire them.

Richard Branson's article on how to delegate.

When starting out, entrepreneurs face seemingly never-ending lists of tasks. I had
to be a jack-of-all-trades at Virgin Records. I had at least 10 job titles (depending
on who I was talking to) – marketing, PR, operations, business development… you name
it, I did it.

Working across so many areas is great because it enables you to learn quickly, broaden
your skill set, and tackle challenges head on with confidence – but we could never
have evolved from a mail-order record retailer to a global brand if I hadn’t learnt
how to delegate early on.

With that in mind, I decided to write up a five-step delegation guide that I’ve
followed over the years. Hopefully you find it helpful too.

1. Identify your strengths and weaknesses. Reflect on the tasks that come naturally
   to you. What elements of the business do you find enjoyable and stress-free? What
   do you find demanding and time-consuming? Ask your friends, family and peers for
   their honest observations too. Once you’ve collected your thoughts and findings,
   write them down and take note of any patterns and themes.

2. Do the same for your business as a whole. Identify any areas where improvement
   is needed, as well as any existing challenges and missing elements that you
   need to attain for your business toscale. This will determine the kind of skill
   sets, assets, experience levels and personal attributes that your business and
   team is lacking.

3. Use your findings to guide recruitment and evaluate your existing team. You need
   to build a dynamic and diverse team if you are going to be able to delegate and
   succeed. Seek out characteristics in people that balance out your less effective
   areas. Take the time to find people who understand the business and can envision
   ways to improve it without losing sight of your vision.

4. Shift the hierarchy and establish a company culture where every idea is welcome,
   communicationis open and collaboration is embedded in every decision. It’s
   important to remember that people are your greatest asset and you need to invest
   in them.

5. Now that you have established a loyal and trustful team with talent in the right
   places, you can sit back and start looking at the big picture. Nevertheless,
   it’s important to remain visible, approachable and connected to all of the
   moving parts of the business.

Delegation is a balancing act but when you get it right, that’s when growth
happens. I hope these steps help you get there.

Remember to ask these before jumping in.

- What are the expectations in terms of arrival and departure times?
- What are your norms for working at home, especially when the weather is bad or I'm not feeling well but not sick enough to take a sick day?
- Who will be evaluating my performance in this role? What are the evaluation criteria?
- Tell me about my most important internal clients and other contacts. What do I need to know about working with each of them -- their particular requirements, quirks, communication styles, etc?
- What do you think will be the most challenging part of the role? What is your advice for surmounting that hurdle?
- What else do I need to know about the culture, the management team and the company?

Re-phrasing dating advices(from Laura Schlessinger) and applying the same attitude to job searching, do fewer of these mistakes:

- Stupid Attachment - Looking for the context of a company to find and define yourself.
- Stupid Courtship - Become a beggar, not a chooser, in the job search ritual because you are desperate.
- Stupid Helplessness – Being too scared and insecure to deal with your rage and turning it into wimpyness instead.
- Stupid Forgiving – Not knowing when to break off a no-win relationship or how to not get involved in the first place.

"Culture is more important than vision. Some leaders have great vision, but have created a toxic
culture where that vision will never happen." Phil Cooke

Signs you work in a toxic environment:

1) Disrespect and belittlement
2) Unreasonable pressure to get short term results at expense of the long term strategy
3) Inequity, unfairness, favoritism, injustice
4) Any kind of harassment and bullying
5) Lack of empathy, of appreciation, of support
6) Excessive control known as micromanagement
7) Morally questionable environments, lack of integrity, encouragement of dishonesty

In an environment like this, no matter how great a vision and strategy are - they will never be executed on.
Great leaders fix toxic cultures.

They empower, involve, listen, appreciate, challenge, support, mentor. They value hard work and
job well done, honesty, integrity, commitment and dedication.
They know "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." Peter Drucker

Новые правила в Калифорнии, которые относятся к найму независимого подрядчика.
Начиная с первого января 2020 года, на плечи работодателя ложится необходимость доказать факт что
независимый подрядчик не является работником компании.

1. Независимый подрядчик регулярно выполняет ту же работу для других компаний.

2. Стоимость услуги диктует подрядчик, а не наниматель.

3. Подрядчик не может использовать офис компании, как свой офис, у него должно быть отдельное
   место работы (которое может включать место жительства), но обязательно отделено от объекта найма.

   только дата завершения проекта.

5. Подрядчику нельзя диктовать как выполнять работу.

6. Если зараз на услугу длиться более чем через шесть месяцев, у подрядчика должна быть лицензия
   на ведение бизнеса в дополнение к любым необходимым профессиональным лицензиям.
