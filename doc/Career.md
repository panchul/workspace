This page is a pile of relatively useful links and snippets related to
job search, on-boarding, working, career-related humour, etc.

I do not have time to curate it properly, the repo in general is more
about technology rather than career advising.

Here is my LinkedIn.com profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/panchul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panchul)

Have fun.

## Law, etc.

---

From Internet:


10 things every new in-house counsel must do within 90 days of their start date:

Meet the team. This is not exclusive to the legal team. Or the executives. Or any specific business unit. Rather, the mandate is to meet everyone you can. This goes from lower level resources all the way through the C-Suite.

Build a brand. Internal stakeholders often view legal as a bottleneck. “It’s stuck in legal“ is common vernacular. You’re not going to change this belief on day one. But you can start chipping away at it the moment you walk through the door.

Take notes. Each company has a unique DNA that permeates throughout the organization. It’s your job to observe, ask questions, and learn how s*** gets done.

Read. If it’s written and important to the company - policies, templates, material contracts, etc. - grab a cup of coffee and starting reading.

Ownership. Nothing irks internal stakeholders more than someone who passes off responsibilities. Take a position and give a recommendation.

Avoid the BS. Jane’s unhappy because Bob received a promotion after only 5 months and she’s worked at the company for a year and blah blah blah. The water cooler discourse may be a thing of the past with so much WFH. Regardless, your an attorney. Stay out of the mud. 

Don’t be naive. Management observes far more than you realize. Unlike a law firm, in-house counsel are an expense on the P&L. This doesn’t diminish the value, but the cost does place a different type of scrutiny on the position.

Organization. Work doesn’t funnel through the partner. Instead, the requests you’ll receive will come from various functions and business units. And people that have unclear roles. The best thing you can do is keep organized and build a system for yourself to keep track of it all.

Prioritization. Everything seems important on day 1. It’s not. Or, at a minimum, some issues are more important than others. Raise your hand and ask for direction if you’re unsure where to start. It’s a bad look to waste cycles on low-impact work.

According to Internet reposts, Elon Musk sent an email to the staff at Tesla
with his 6 rules for productivity:

1) Avoid large meetings. Large meetings waste valuable time and energy.
- They discourage debate
- People are more guarded than open
- There's not enough time for everyone to contribute
  Don't schedule large meetings unless you're certain they provide value to everyone.

2) Leave a meeting if you're not contributing. If a meeting doesn't require your:
- Input
- Value
- Decisions
  Your presence is useless.
  It's not rude to leave a meeting.
  But it's rude to waste people's time.

3) Forget the chain of command
   Communicate with colleagues directly.
   Not through supervisors or managers.
   Fast communicators make fast decisions.
   Fast decisions = competitive advantage.

4) Be clear, not clever. Avoid nonsense words and technical jargon.
   It slows down communication.
   Choose words that are:
- Concise
- To the point
- Easy to understand
  Don't sound smart. Be efficient.

5) Ditch frequent meetings. There's no better way to waste everyone's time.
   Use meetings to:
- Collaborate
- Attack issues head-on
- Solve urgent problems
  But once you resolve the issue, frequent meetings are no longer necessary.
  You can resolve most issues without a meeting.
  Instead of meetings:
- Send a text
- Send an email
- Communicate on a discord or slack channel
  Don't interrupt your team's workflow if it's unnecessary.

6) Use common sense. If a company rule doesn't:
- Make sense
- Contribute to progress
- Apply to your specific situation
  Avoid following the rule with your eyes closed.
  Don't follow rules. Follow principles.

The manifesto that Phil Knight created for Nike in 1980 had 10 simple rules:

1. Our business is change.
2. We're on offense.
3. Perfect results > perfect process.
4. This is as much about battle as about business.
5. Assume nothing, make sure people keep their promises, push yourselves and others, stretch the possible.
6. Live off the land.
7. Your job isn't done until THE job is done.
8. Dangers: Bureaucracy, personal ambition, energy takers vs. givers, knowing our weaknesses, too many things on the platter.
9. It won't be pretty.
10. If we do the right things we'll make money damn near automatic.

At some companies you look around yourself and see that your co-workers seem to
be practicing the CIA manual. Stay away from those. :-)

From the CIA's declassified saboteur guidance, to disrupt an advisory from within is to:

- Insist on doing everything through "channels." Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.

- When possible, refer all matters to committees, for "further study and consideration." Attempt to make the committee as large as possible - never less than five.

- Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.

- Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.

- Advocate "caution." Be "reasonable" and urge your fellow-conferees to be "reasonable" and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.

- Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those which have the least flaw.

- To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.

- Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.

- See that three people have to approve everything where one would do.

- Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skillful worker.

- See that important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers.

- Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can.

- Work slowly

51 Essential Machine Learning Interview Questions and Answers
https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-interview-questions/

---

When acquaintances ask for my mentoring advice on their career path, the very first thing
I always do is discourage them from individual-contributor contracts. 

I tried it in the past, and I was actually lucky to have met good teams and stay in touch with
colleagues I met through consulting, but, on average, it is a commodity-labor sweat-shop environment,
you might end up doing the bulk of the work, underpaid, underappreciated, and discarded
the moment your client's short-sighted roadmap hits the last page of the PowerPoint presentation.

I always emphasize contracting is not Computer Science. It is a mundane dead-end blue-collar transaction.
Nobody bothers discussing supersonic hydrodynamics with a plumber who fixes a broken toilet, right?
You will not be invited to co-author journal papers and patents - sharing intellectual
property with vendors is a legal headache.

Because you are not a professional salary negotiator, your staffing company can easily be
taking 1/3 of what client pays and do nothing in return except for the initial presenting of your profile.
You will have very limited control over what you do and how you do it. It is not uncommon to have to
shadow write for your bosses and then see them taking all the credit without mentioning you exist.

It is ok to explore and make the best of it, but what will be in YOUR best interests is to
find a direct-hire FTE job somewhere else and leave faster than your middleman could spell 'counteroffer'.

One more thing, once you are the boss, try being honest and compassionate to the contractors if
you do need to hire them.

Richard Branson's article on how to delegate.

When starting out, entrepreneurs face seemingly never-ending lists of tasks. I had
to be a jack-of-all-trades at Virgin Records. I had at least 10 job titles (depending
on who I was talking to) - marketing, PR, operations, business development... you name
it, I did it.

Working across so many areas is great because it enables you to learn quickly, broaden
your skill set, and tackle challenges head on with confidence - but we could never
have evolved from a mail-order record retailer to a global brand if I hadn't learnt
how to delegate early on.

With that in mind, I decided to write up a five-step delegation guide that I've
followed over the years. Hopefully you find it helpful too.

1. Identify your strengths and weaknesses. Reflect on the tasks that come naturally
   to you. What elements of the business do you find enjoyable and stress-free? What
   do you find demanding and time-consuming? Ask your friends, family and peers for
   their honest observations too. Once you've collected your thoughts and findings,
   write them down and take note of any patterns and themes.

2. Do the same for your business as a whole. Identify any areas where improvement
   is needed, as well as any existing challenges and missing elements that you
   need to attain for your business toscale. This will determine the kind of skill
   sets, assets, experience levels and personal attributes that your business and
   team is lacking.

3. Use your findings to guide recruitment and evaluate your existing team. You need
   to build a dynamic and diverse team if you are going to be able to delegate and
   succeed. Seek out characteristics in people that balance out your less effective
   areas. Take the time to find people who understand the business and can envision
   ways to improve it without losing sight of your vision.

4. Shift the hierarchy and establish a company culture where every idea is welcome,
   communicationis open and collaboration is embedded in every decision. It's
   important to remember that people are your greatest asset and you need to invest
   in them.

5. Now that you have established a loyal and trustful team with talent in the right
   places, you can sit back and start looking at the big picture. Nevertheless,
   it's important to remain visible, approachable and connected to all of the
   moving parts of the business.

Delegation is a balancing act but when you get it right, that’s when growth
happens. I hope these steps help you get there.

- Who will be evaluating my performance in this role? What are the evaluation criteria?
- Tell me about my most important internal clients and other contacts. What do I need to know about working with each of them -- their particular requirements, quirks, communication styles, etc?
- What do you think will be the most challenging part of the role? What is your advice for surmounting that hurdle?
- What else do I need to know about the culture, the management team and the company?

Re-phrasing dating advices(from Laura Schlessinger) and applying the same attitude to job searching, do fewer of these mistakes:

- Stupid Attachment - Looking for the context of a company to find and define yourself.
- Stupid Courtship - Become a beggar, not a chooser, in the job search ritual because you are desperate.
- Stupid Helplessness - Being too scared and insecure to deal with your rage and turning it into wimpyness instead.
- Stupid Forgiving - Not knowing when to break off a no-win relationship or how to not get involved in the first place.

"Culture is more important than vision. Some leaders have great vision, but have created a toxic
culture where that vision will never happen." Phil Cooke

Signs you work in a toxic environment:

1) Disrespect and belittlement
2) Unreasonable pressure to get short term results at expense of the long term strategy
3) Inequity, unfairness, favoritism, injustice
4) Any kind of harassment and bullying
5) Lack of empathy, of appreciation, of support
6) Excessive control known as micromanagement
7) Morally questionable environments, lack of integrity, encouragement of dishonesty

In an environment like this, no matter how great a vision and strategy are - they will never be executed on.
Great leaders fix toxic cultures.

They empower, involve, listen, appreciate, challenge, support, mentor. They value hard work and
job well done, honesty, integrity, commitment and dedication.
They know "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." Peter Drucker

- Dynamic programming: https://lnkd.in/d85BHsQp

I would say 1/2 of my coding questions was graph related, and I used topsort, MST, union find during my interviews so its worth knowing them well.

Great resource on Binary Search (esp. for harder variants): https://lnkd.in/dPVikn9e

Quite a few LC hards involve binary search as part of its solution, but its non-obvious.

At staff level, you are expected to have great communication, come up with one or more high level solutions in reasonable time with space and time complexity, implement mostly correct, and check for errors independently.

2. SYSTEM DESIGN

Always ask clarifying questions, they are meant to be vague.

No. 1 tip: Pay for mock interviews, take extensive notes, study, pay for more interviews. I used igotanoffer.com. Try booking different interviewers, they have different expectations, communication, friendliness.

Grokking system design: https://lnkd.in/dKBtGDDG

It's good to complete grokking, but in practice its a little too shallow for staff level.

Watch all videos and take notes from this channel: https://lnkd.in/d32sycXJ

Most other channels like Exponent are actually not great examples of a good interviewee for staff level.

Read papers on Dynamo, BigTable, MapReduce, Cassandra, Raft, Lamport Clocks, etc.

A lot of material written by this Medium writer is great: https://lnkd.in/d_4yxAA7

Memorize Jeff Dean's latency numbers: https://lnkd.in/dq42yWsa

If you have time, read DDIA: https://dataintensive.net

I memorized mnemonics for structure of how I execute my interview, as well as for each topic. Like OSI model, caching strategies, load balancing strategies, database types, etc. You need to make up your own in order to ingrain them.
